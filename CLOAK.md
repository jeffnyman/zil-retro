# Cloak of Darkness

## Getting Started

Let's start by creating a basic template for a game so we can get started:

```
"Cloak of Darkness"

<CONSTANT GAME-BANNER
"Cloak of Darkness|
A basic IF demonstration.|
Original game by Roger Firth|
ZIL conversion by Jesse McGrew, Jayson Smith, and Josh Lawrence|
Tutorial version by Jeff Nyman.">

<INSERT-FILE "parser">
```

All of this is covered in the [tutorial](https://github.com/jeffnyman/zil-retro/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md). In order for this to compile at all, you will need a `GO` routine. We know how to create that from the tutorial as well but let's use our exploration of *Cloak of Darkess* to build up some understanding.

## The Game Loop

According to the *ZIL Course* document:

> "The flexibility and complexity allowed in INTERLOGIC games are almost wholly due to the parser/main loop combination."

It continues:

> "It is best to think of the parser as a black box with from one to three outputs: an action to be performed, a direct object, and an indirect object. Each of the three corresponds to a GLOBAL ATOM: PRSA, PRSO, and PRSI, respectively."

The main loop starts with a call to the parser. Ultimately a command is received from the player and that command is run through the parser. If there is a "parser failure", this means that the parser was not able to break the command into the PRSA, PRSO, or PRSI. Thus nothing further happens and the loop is restarted.

If the parser succeeds in "understanding" the command, it will pass the "parts of speech" (PRSA, PRSO, PRSI) to the rest of the program. What this means is that the three ATOMs are set (using an operation called `SETG`). The game gets to decide which object will handle the command. What this means is that a number of ROUTINE objects will be called in turn to determine the result of the player's intended action.

According to the *ZIL Course*:

> "In ZIL, we say that a ROUTINE ’handled’ the player’s action if it finishes all of the processing required for that action. Each ROUTINE decides whether or not it considers the action ’handled’, and its decision is final. A ROUTINE ’handles’ an action simply by returning a ’non-false’ (i.e. anything other than a ’false’)."

By convention, the object in PRSI gets the first attempt at handling the command. This is assuming there is a PRSI, since a command does not have to have one. According to *Learning ZIL*:

> "What this means, is that if PRSI has an associated object action routine, that action routine tries to handle the input. If it does so, the current turn is considered to be complete."

However, if there is no PRSI or it does not contain such an action routine, then the object held by PRSO is given the next shot at handling. If the PRSO also doesn’t handle the input (because it has no routine to do so), the task falls to the routine associated with the verb.

The PRSO and PRSI routines can give very specific responses to the input. Whereas the routine associated with the verb is generally considered the "default response" and is the least interesting and/or most generic.

*Learning ZIL* gives a good example:

```
>HIT THE OAK CHEST WITH THE CROWBAR
The crowbar bends! It appears to be made of rubber, not iron!
```

Here the "oak chest" is the PRSO and the "crowbar" is the PRSI. The above output was handled by the action routine on the PRSI.

```
>HIT THE OAK CHEST WITH THE CROWBAR
The sound of the impact reverberates inside the chest.
```

This output was handled by the action routine on the PRSO.

```
>HIT THE OAK CHEST WITH THE CROWBAR
Hitting the oak chest accomplishes nothing.
```

Here neither the PRSI nor PRSO provided an action routine and so action handling fell to the object in the PRSA, which would be "hit", and that provided a default response. Behind the scenes the default action handler for HIT might be this:

```zil
<TELL "Hitting the " D .OBJ " accomplishes nothing." CR>
```

So you can see that if HIT for a specific OBJECT wants to do something different, then the OBJECT itself must supply a ROUTINE to ’handle’ the HIT action. Any object can provide such a routine by having an ACTION property on it.

As stated, actions don’t have to have a PRSI. As an example, "take oak chest" only has a PRSA and a PRSO. Actions also don’t have to have a PRSO. As an example, "inventory" or "jump" or "scream" all have a PRSA and nothing else. If there is no PRSI or PRSO, the value of it is set to false. There must always be a PRSA or there will be a parser failure.

## Routines

According to to the *ZIL Course* document:

> "ROUTINEs are user-constructed subroutines which are the backbone of the INTERLOGIC games."

According to the *Learning ZIL* document:

> "A routine is the most common item that makes up ZIL code."

The schematic of a routine is:

```
<ROUTINE ROUTINE - NAME ( argument - list )
  <expressions of the routine >>
```

Each ROUTINE has a "NAME", which, in the context of MDL and ZIL, is a GLOBAL ATOM. This means the routine can be referenced by any part of your program. In fact, it's this very ATOM that the interpreter will be looking for. So let's put that in our source:

```zil
<ROUTINE GO ()>
```

The argument list appears within parentheses after the routine name. Arguments are variables used only within the specific routine. In many cases, a routine will have no arguments; in that case, the argument list must still appear, but as an empty set of parentheses.

When a game first starts, the first thing the interpreter does is to call a routine called `GO`. You can put a lot of expressions in `GO` if you want but the last thing that `GO` should do is call the routine called `MAIN-LOOP`. `MAIN-LOOP` is what starts the processing logic. Every routine in the game is directly or indirectly called by `MAIN-LOOP`. As *Learning ZIL* puts it:

> "MAIN-LOOP is basically a giant REPEAT which loops once for each turn of the game."

So let's add that to our routine:

```zil
<ROUTINE GO ()
  <MAIN-LOOP>
>
```

Let's consider a schematic of this main loop:

```
<ROUTINE MAIN - LOOP ( argument-list )
  <REPEAT ()
    <PARSER>
    <COND (<did -the - parser - fail ?>
      <AGAIN >)>
    <PERFORM ,PRSA ,PRSO ,PRSI >
    <COND (<did -this -input -cause -time -to - pass ?>
      <call -room - function -with -M-END>
      <CLOCKER>)>>>
```

Consistent with the above details, the parser is called first so the command from the player can be inspected.

If there is a parser failure at this point, some failure message will be printed, and the turn is considered complete. The loop starts over again. That's what AGAIN is basically doing; it sends processing to the top of the REPEAT.

If the parser succeeds at this point, it identifies the PRSA, PRSO, and PRSI, again as described before. Then a routine called `PERFORM` is called. This routine uses all of that information to allow the action routines of PRSI and/or PRSO a chance to handle the input. If not, the verb default will handle the input. MAIN-LOOP then causes any events to occur via M-END and CLOCKER but that only happens if the action taken was one that was "in world" which means it caused time to pass.

The MAIN-LOOP runs over and over until something tells the interpreter to quit the game. A common way that would happen is with the `V-QUIT` expression which calls the `<QUIT>` instruction. This corresponds to the player typing "quit" in the game.

Every routine in a game is activated by being called by some other routine. A routine calls another routine by putting the name of the called routine at the appropriate place, inside brackets.

According to the *ZIL Course*:

> "When a ROUTINE is called, each of the expressions is evaluated in turn and the result of the last evaluation is the value of the call to the ROUTINE."

So let's add our own routine and have our `GO` routine call it:

```zil
<ROUTINE GO ()
  <INIT>
  <MAIN-LOOP>
>

<ROUTINE INIT ()>
```

If you try to compile this, you'll get an interesting error message:

```
ROUTINE requires 3 or more args
```

This is referring to the `INIT` routine we just created. I just talked about arguments earlier as part of the argument list so you might think that what's being asked for are three arguments in the parentheses for this routine. However, that's not the case. What is needed here is at least one function call. To see this, add the following:

```zil
<ROUTINE INIT ()
  <V-VERSION>
>
```

This will now compile. The trick here is that you have to understand the form `ROUTINE` is the name of a function. But isn't `INIT` the name of our function? Yes, but in a Lisp-like language, the keyword to define a function is "ROUTINE" and it takes three arguments. The first of those is the name (in our case, `INIT`), the second of those is the parameter list, and then the third is at least one function call (which for us is `V-VERSION`).

## The Starting Room

We saw in the tutorial the idea of defining an object that was the location where the player could begin. Let's put that in place for our game, which starts in a foyer.

```zil
<ROOM FOYER
  (IN ROOMS)
  (DESC "Foyer of the Opera House")
  (FLAGS LIGHTBIT)
>
```

I showed you something very similar in the tutorial, one difference here being that instead of using `OBJECT`, I'm using `ROOM`. This is a concept provided by the ZILF library. To quote *Learning ZIL*:

> The first thing in a room definition is the word ROOM followed by the internal name of the room.

I talked about the use of `IN` (or `LOC`) in the tutorial but to once again quote *Learning ZIL*:

> All rooms are located in a special object called the ROOMS object.

The `DESC` is the description which, in contrast to the "internal name" mentioned above, is the "external name" of the room. This is the only name for the room that they player will ever see.

I'm also making sure the room is lit so the player will be able to see in it. Note that you'll read this in *Learning ZIL*:

> ONBIT means that the room is always lit.

So the `ONBIT` there is equivalent to the `LIGHTBIT`. But that's different than what ZIL seems to have been. The definition of `ONBIT` in *Learning ZIL* is:

> ONBIT: In the case of a room, this means that the room is lit. If your game takes place during the day, any outdoor room should have the ONBIT. In the case of an object, this means that the object is providing light. An object with the ONBIT should also have the LIGHTBIT.

The distinction seems to be that `ONBIT` means the object or room is providing light at all times whereas the `LIGHTBIT` means the object can be providing light but it can also be extinguished.

In fact, we'll have to do what we did in the initial tutorial by making sure to put the player in that room at the start. So change your `INIT` routine as such:

```zil
<ROUTINE INIT ()
  <V-VERSION>
  <SETG HERE ,FOYER>
  <MOVE ,PLAYER ,HERE>
  <V-LOOK>
>
```

This will place the player in the foyer and perform an initial look action.

If you try this out, you'll find that your output in the game looks a little messy, with everything sort of jumbled together. The game also just dumps you in the foyer without providing any context for the narrative. So let's change the `INIT` routine to look like this:

```zil
<ROUTINE INIT ()
  <CRLF> <CRLF>
  <TELL "Hurrying through the rainswept November night, you're glad to see the bright lights of the Opera House. It's surprising that there aren't more people about but, hey, what do you expect in a cheap demo game...?" CR CR>
  <V-VERSION> <CRLF>
  <SETG HERE ,FOYER>
  <MOVE ,PLAYER ,HERE>
  <V-LOOK>
>
```

The `TELL` atom refers to a kind of routine that's called a macro. This particular macro deals with printing everything the user sees as output. In its simplest use, as in the above example, `TELL` does nothing more than take the string provided as an argument and prints it. The `CR` after the string means "carriage return." But we've already done `CRLF` ("carriage return line feed"). What's the difference? Apparently there isn't one.

Our room is still a little boring in that all we have is the description. Let's provide a longer description to the player. Change the foyer object to look like this:

```zil
<ROOM FOYER
  (IN ROOMS)
  (DESC "Foyer of the Opera House")
  (LDESC "You are standing in a spacious hall, splendidly decorated in red and gold, with glittering chandeliers overhead. The entrance from the street is to the north, and there are doorways south and west.")
  (FLAGS LIGHTBIT)
>
```

According to *Learning ZIL*:

> If a room’s description never changes, it can have an LDESC property, a string which is the room’s unchanging description.

You might wonder how you would handle situations where a description might change. In that case, you would have to create an action routine for the room. We'll get to that concept a bit later in the Cloak example.

## More Rooms

Let's add a few other rooms just to flesh out the game world a bit.

```zil
<ROOM BAR
  (IN ROOMS)
  (DESC "Foyer Bar")
  (LDESC "The bar, much rougher than you'd have guessed after the opulence of the foyer to the north, is completely empty.")
>

<ROOM CLOAKROOM
  (IN ROOMS)
  (DESC "Cloakroom")
  (LDESC "The walls of this small room were clearly once lined with hooks, though now only one remains. The exit is a door to the east.")
  (FLAGS LIGHTBIT)
>
```

You might notice that `BAR` does not contain a flag for the room to be lit. That's intentional.

## Connections Between Rooms

While these rooms now exist, the player can't actually go to them. For that we need to define exits on the rooms. Change the `BAR` and `CLOAKROOM` objects as such:

```zil
<ROOM BAR
  (IN ROOMS)
  (DESC "Foyer Bar")
  (LDESC "The bar, much rougher than you'd have guessed after the opulence of the foyer to the north, is completely empty.")
  (NORTH TO FOYER)
>

<ROOM CLOAKROOM
  (IN ROOMS)
  (DESC "Cloakroom")
  (LDESC "The walls of this small room were clearly once lined with hooks, though now only one remains. The exit is a door to the east.")
  (EAST TO FOYER)
  (FLAGS LIGHTBIT)
>
```

What this is doing is creating a type of `UEXIT`, which stands for "unconditional exit." What this means is that if the player is in a room with such an exit and goes in the direction provided as an argument to the exit, the player will unconditionally go to the room listed as part of the exit. So here if the player is in the "Bar" and does north, they will go to the "Foyer." This will happen all the time.

However, we need a way to get out of our starting room. Easy enough:

```zil
<ROOM FOYER
  (IN ROOMS)
  (DESC "Foyer of the Opera House")
  (LDESC "You are standing in a spacious hall, splendidly decorated in red and gold, with glittering chandeliers overhead. The entrance from the street is to the north, and there are doorways south and west.")
  (SOUTH TO BAR)
  (WEST TO CLOAKROOM)
  (FLAGS LIGHTBIT)
>
```

This is basically how you build a series of connections between locations. There are other types of exits, not all of which I'll cover in the Cloak example. But let's consider one other one. Add the following to the `FOYER` object:

```zil
<ROOM FOYER
  (IN ROOMS)
  (DESC "Foyer of the Opera House")
  (LDESC "You are standing in a spacious hall, splendidly decorated in red and gold, with glittering chandeliers overhead. The entrance from the street is to the north, and there are doorways south and west.")
  (SOUTH TO BAR)
  (WEST TO CLOAKROOM)
  (NORTH SORRY "You've only just arrived, and besides, the weather outside seems to be getting worse.")
  (FLAGS LIGHTBIT)
>
```

Here we've added an exit (`NORTH`) but we have an argument called `SORRY`. What does that mean? *Learning ZIL* gives us this info:

> The NEXIT (for non-exit) is simply a direction in which you can never go, but for which you want something more interesting than the default "You can’t go that way." response. The game will recognize it as an NEXIT because of the use of "SORRY."

Compiling this example will let you move between rooms.

## Adding an Object

Now let's add an object to our game. In fact, we'll add an object that provides a reason for the title of the game. This will be the cloak object. Let's start with this:

```zil
<OBJECT CLOAK
  (IN PLAYER)
  (DESC "cloak")
>
```

Pretty simple and very similar to how we defined a room. Here we are saying that the cloak is `IN` the `PLAYER` but we could have made it be `IN` the `FOYER`, as just another example. While a room will always be in the `ROOMS` object, a generic game object can be wherever you want it to start. The `DESC` is similar to that for a room in that it just says how the object will be described to the player.

Let's add a few more things:

```zil
<OBJECT CLOAK
  (IN PLAYER)
  (DESC "cloak")
  (SYNONYM CLOAK)
  (ADJECTIVE DARK)
>
```

The `SYNONYM` is a list of all the nouns which can be used to refer to the object. Here I only have one but I could add others by including them as a spaced list, as such:

```zil
(SYNONYM CLOAK GARMENT)
```

The `ADJECTIVE` is a list of adjectives which can be used to refer to the object. To quote *Learning ZIL*:

> An object, to be referred to, must have at least one synonym; the ADJECTIVE property is optional.

Now let's add some flags to our objects:

```zil
<OBJECT CLOAK
  (IN PLAYER)
  (DESC "cloak")
  (SYNONYM CLOAK)
  (ADJECTIVE DARK)
  (FLAGS TAKEBIT WEARBIT WORNBIT)
>
```

The `TAKEBIT` flag means that the cloak can be picked up by the player. In fact, we already set that situation up because the cloak starts `IN` the `PLAYER` which would default to the player carrying it. However, without the `TAKEBIT` flag, the player would not be able to pick up the cloak again if they dropped it. The `WEARBIT` indicates that the cloak can be worn. This only means that the object is wearable, not that it is actually being worn. However, `WORNBIT` means that a wearable object like the cloak is currently being worn.

If you compile the game with these changes and place and type "i" or "inventory", you'll see the following:

```
> i
You are carrying:
   a cloak (worn)
```

To make sure we got this down, let's add another simple object:

```zil
<OBJECT HOOK
  (IN CLOAKROOM)
  (DESC "small brass hook")
  (FDESC "A small brass hook is on the wall.")
  (SYNONYM HOOK PEG)
  (ADJECTIVE SMALL BRASS)
  (FLAGS CONTBIT SURFACEBIT)
>
```

This is similar to our cloak object in many ways but let's call out the differences.

The `FDESC` property is a string which is used to describe the object until the player picks it up for the first time. In other words, it describes the object in its original or first state. In this case, however, the hook can't be taken. (There's no `TAKEBIT` flag.) So why would this extra description matter? What this does is provide the "first description" every time the player enters the room. It's a way to keep calling attention to the hook.

We have a few new flags here. The `CONTBIT` means the object is a container and thus things can be put inside it. As a container it can also potentially be opened and closed. The `SURFACEBIT` means the object acts as a surface. This means objects can be placed on top of it. *Learning ZIL* indicates this:

> Any object with the SURFACEBIT should also have the CONTBIT (since you can put things on the surface) and the OPENBIT (since you can't close a countertop as you can a box).

Note that this actually doesn't make a lot of sense as described. In fact, it seems entirely backwards. The `OPENBIT` referred to indicates that an object is a door or container and is open. But that doesn't apply to a surface.

## Action Routines

Rooms and objects can have action routines defined on. We'll do this for a room soon. But for now let's start with a simple example by placing an action routine on an object. Change your cloak object so it looks like this:

```zil
<OBJECT CLOAK
  (IN PLAYER)
  (DESC "cloak")
  (SYNONYM CLOAK)
  (ADJECTIVE DARK)
  (FLAGS TAKEBIT WEARBIT WORNBIT)
  (ACTION CLOAK-R)
>
```

The `ACTION` property identifies `CLOAK-R` as the action routine which tries to handle inputs relating to the cloak. Now let's create this routine. I'm going to give you the whole thing here and then I'll explain it. Add the following to your file:

```zil
<ROUTINE CLOAK-R ()
  <COND (<VERB? EXAMINE> <TELL "The cloak is unnaturally dark." CR>)>
>
```

This routine demonstrates one of the simplest and commonest types of predicates. `<VERB? EXAMIME>` is true if EXAMINE is the PRSA identified by the parser. If that condition is true, then the following code occurs, which is to simply use `TELL` to print a string. This works, however, because of the use of `COND` which is short for "conditional." You can think of this as an if-then type of construct.

The basic form of a `COND` is this:

```
<COND (<if true >
       <then do this >)>
```

The "if true" part is referred to as the predicate. A predicate is basically anything in ZIL whose value can be true or false. So you can think of the predicate as asking a particular question that needs to be reduced to an answer of "yes" (true) or "no" (false).
