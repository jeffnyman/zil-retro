# ZIL Retro

This repository is a staging location for my forays into playing around with ZIL.

I will be using the [ZILF](https://bitbucket.org/jmcgrew/zilf/wiki/Home) tool as part of this. In fact, this repository contains the 0.8 version of ZILF (in the `bin` directory) but with an updated library (in the `library` directory). I did this just to make it a bit easier on myself or anyone using this repository. Currently the way to get ZILF up and running is not very user-friendly, depending on your experience with such things. I do have an [install guide](https://github.com/jeffnyman/zil-retro/blob/master/INSTALL.md), at least for how I did things.

As far as editors to support ZIL code, there is a [ZIL Visual Studio Code](https://bitbucket.org/jmcgrew/zil-editor-support/src/default/) extension. I have also written and deployed a [ZIL Atom Grammar](https://atom.io/packages/language-zil). My version is nowhere near as full-featured as the one for Visual Studio but it's more than enough for me right now.

As far as how to actually write something in ZIL, I'm in the process of creating a [ZIL Tutorial](https://github.com/jeffnyman/zil-retro/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md).

I do provide a few ZIL reference documents that I've come across.

* [ZILCourse.pdf](https://github.com/jeffnyman/zil-retro/blob/master/docs/ZILCourse.pdf): A "ZIL Course" by Marc S. Blank (October 1982). This is a transcription of the original Infocom document `zil-course.fsf` found on the PAX USB Drive.

* [LearningZIL.pdf](https://github.com/jeffnyman/zil-retro/blob/master/docs/ZILLearning.pdf): This is a transcription of Steven Meretzky's original document on "Learning ZIL", which was dated from 1989.

There are details on the [PAX USB Drive](http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/PAX_USB_Drive) if you're curious including the the [PAX USB Puzzle Collection](http://pr-if.org/doc/paxeast-usb/).
