# ZIL Retro

This repository is a staging location for my forays into playing around with ZIL. I'm also planning to write some tutorials since the details on ZIL, and on modern tools to use it, is a bit scarce.

I will be using the [ZILF](https://bitbucket.org/jmcgrew/zilf/wiki/Home) tool as part of this. In fact, this repository contains the 0.8 version of ZILF (in the `bin` directory) but with an updated library (in the `library` directory). I did this just to make it a bit easier on myself or anyone using this repository. Currently the way to get ZILF up and running is not very user-friendly, depending on your experience with such things. I do have an [install guide](https://github.com/jeffnyman/zil-retro/blob/master/INSTALL.md), at least for how I did things.

As far as editors to support ZIL code, there is a [ZIL Visual Studio Code](https://bitbucket.org/jmcgrew/zil-editor-support/src/default/) extension. I have also written and deployed a [ZIL Atom Grammar](https://atom.io/packages/language-zil). My version is nowhere near as full-featured as the one for Visual Studio but it's more than enough for me right now.
