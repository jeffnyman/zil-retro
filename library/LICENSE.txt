  binary z-code file compiled by the ZILF compiler, the appearance of the
  library version number within the text of the introductory title credits of
  your game (text that is displayed to a person who plays your z-code file
  via a z-code interpreter) is sufficient to satisfy the requirements for
  redistribution of said binary z-code file. (By default, using <V-VERSION>
  in your game's source code will display the library version number to a
  person playing your game on a z-code interpreter.)
