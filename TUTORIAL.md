# Tutorial

By this point you should have a working ZILF implementation set up on your machine in whatever way you want. As long as you can execute the `zilf.exe` and `zapf.exe` files, you should be fine.

## Running ZILF Interpreter

This is a bit of a side path to creating games but you can use ZILF as a real-time interpreter. This can help you try out constructs that you learn in ZIL to see how they work. How this works is that you can start ZILF with no parameters to enter an interactive mode. In this mode, ZILF can interpret top-level ZIL constructs without compiling. MDL could similarly be run in an interactive mode. If you are familiar with languages like Ruby, Python, or JavaScript you'll likely recognize this is like a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), where you enter an MDL or ZIL expression, and ZILF evaluates it and immediately prints a response.

By the way, if you're wondering what "ZIL" and "MDL" are all about, check out my [ZIL context](https://github.com/jeffnyman/zil-retro/blob/master/CONTEXT.md).
